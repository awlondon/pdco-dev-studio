# Costing Guidelines

## Cost classes
- `light`: docs updates, schema edits, small scaffolds.
- `medium`: multi-file feature additions, test expansion, moderate refactors.
- `heavy`: dependency overhauls, broad architectural migrations, large data operations.

## Practical controls
- Prefer `light` tasks as default.
- Split `medium/heavy` work into independent packets with measurable outcomes.
- Avoid non-essential installs and broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
